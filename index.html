      <h2>His story</h2>
      <p>His story is no ordinally one as he was taken away from his mother as a puppy. As sad as this may be I had mercy for the poor thing and took him in as mine and promised that I would once again re-unite him with his mother. Weeks later his mother
        died for being misreable without her child, so I promised myself to love him and take care of him. As we grew found of each other I named him <strong>Dexture</strong> from my favourite cartoon.</p><br/>
      <p>I trained him up on how to understand people and also where to do its businesses when it needs to go. His has some very impressiveskills like :-</p>
      <li>Trying to talk back whenever talked to</li>
      <li>Swimming in diferent styles and diving</li>
      <li>Playing fetch most of the time</li>
      <li>Going for walks around the neighbour hood</li>
